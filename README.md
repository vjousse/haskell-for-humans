# Haskell for humans

An attempt at documenting my learnings with Haskell.

# Build & Run

This website is using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so you will need some `Ruby` goodness first.

1. Get `Ruby` for your operating system by visiting the [official website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

2. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) command in the project directory:

   ```bash
   bundle
   ```

3. Start the dev server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
